Code examples in documentation should be clear, concise, and easy to understand for all audiences. They should adhere to industry standards and best practices, as users may copy and run the sample code in production environments.

Be sure to include comments with warnings on what may occur when running that code. Make no assumptions about the reader's familiarity with libraries, frameworks, preprocessors, or other non-native features.
Clarify when you're adding a code snippet and not a complete example. Provide information about any packages or dependencies required to run the sample code.

Code examples should be self-explanatory and easy to understand. The goal is to provide simplified working examples that can be understood as soon as possible, not necessarily to create efficient, brilliant code that impresses experts and has outstanding utility.

## General Guidelines
- Include line-by-line comments to explain the code's functionality.
- Add warnings about potential issues when running the code.
- Provide all necessary information to run the example, including dependencies and setup instructions.
- Make no assumptions about the reader's familiarity with libraries, frameworks, or non-native features.
- Clarify when providing a code snippet rather than a complete example.
- Keep examples focused and self-contained, avoiding unnecessary dependencies.

## Formatting 

### Code length

- Keep code lines short enough to avoid horizontal scrolling.

- Break large lines at appropriate points without compromising best practices.

- Aim for 15-25 lines per code block. For longer examples, consider showing only the most relevant snippet and linking to the full example.


### Colors and Syntax Highlighting
Color plays an important role in syntax highlighting, making code samples easier to read and understand code. Use color in a consistent and accessible way to make code examples accessible to everyone.

- Use a consistent and accessible color scheme for syntax highlighting.

- Ensure sufficient contrast between colors for easy distinction.

- Use color to differentiate between code elements (e.g., keywords, variables, comments).

- Test your color scheme with color blindness simulators for accessibility.


### Spacing and Indentation

- Place the characters for the open-brace ("") on the same line.

- Use two spaces per indentation level.

- Add proper spacing between code blocks

- After adding comments, start writing code from the next line.
